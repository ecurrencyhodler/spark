    /* Turbo has this really odd behavior where it runs dependent tasks of workspaces even when
       the script doesn't exist there. There's a long running discussion to change this here, but
       until then it's easiest to declare dependencies in the workspace turbo config itself. Let's
       leave it for unit tests `test` since the task is in every workspace anyways and it would
       be more work to maintain turbo configs in every workspace. https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/937 */
